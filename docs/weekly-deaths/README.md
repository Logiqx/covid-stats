## Background

Delays in the death registration / reporting processes and the effects of bank holidays can make the interpretation of weekly data from the ONS somewhat tricky and prone to misinterpretation.

The goal of these charts is to provide the clearest view possible of the weekly deaths reported by the ONS for England and Wales from 2010 onwards.

These charts are all based on the date of occurrence (date of death) which makes interpretation much more straightforward but comparisons of weekly registrations versus weekly occurrences are also provided.



## Technical Explanation

An explanation of the processing used for all 9 regions of England and Wales can be found in a separate article.

- [Estimating Regional Deaths by Date of Occurrence](../estimating-regional-occurrences/README.md)

All of the code and data used for this project are available on GitHub, accessible via the explanation article.



## Latest Charts

These charts will be posted as threads on Twitter with 3 images per tweet - e.g. London + South East + East of England.
