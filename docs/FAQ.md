### Introduction

Let me begin this article by stating that I am not an epidemiologist, virologist or microbiologist and that I'm a software engineer who has been something of a data geek for around 25 years. I worked in data warehousing and related reporting in the 90's, data engineering and analytics since the turn of the millennium and focused on data science projects in recent years.

Since mid-February, I have acquired a keen interest in the data and developments relating to SARS-CoV-2 (virus) and COVID-19 (disease). Early in March it became apparent that COVID-19 was going to have a huge impact in the UK (and the rest of the world) so since the second week of March, I've been tracking the progress of COVID-19 across Europe, especially in the UK.

I've written a couple of articles using official statistics (e.g. ["Analysis of Excess Deaths"](https://logiqx.github.io/ons-stats/) (over the past 50 years) and "[UK Trends and Observations](https://logiqx.github.io/covid-stats/)") and have created this FAQ to answer a couple of questions that I am frequently asked by friends.



### Why are UK COVID-19 cases rising but deaths still dropping?

TLDR; This question is a lot more complicated than people might assume and cannot be simply explained by "we're testing more".

We have to consider what the positive test results show at this point in time. The current availability of testing is quite different to back in March / April in the UK, when tests were generally limited to the people who were ill enough to be admitted to hospital. Now we're testing far more people, more regularly and for more reasons (including increased testing in hot spots and testing of close contacts), so we are now detecting many more of the asymptomatic, pre-symptomatic and mild cases in the community.

The typical lag between initial infection and hospital admission appears to be around 2-3 weeks and the typical time between hospital admission and death is typically an additional 1-2 weeks. When you also factor in that a lot of the latest positive cases are currently the "younger" population (e.g. under 40), you have multiple factors that result in an expectation of fewer daily deaths at this point in time; younger people, milder symptoms and a lag time between infections, hospital admissions and deaths of the vulnerable.

It is important to understand that we can't directly compare the latest daily case numbers with the daily case numbers of previous months (e.g. "August 27 was the highest number of daily cases since June") because the percentage of daily cases requiring hospital admission will now be lower due to the nature of the cases (e.g. milder symptoms or younger people) and combined with the lag times mentioned earlier, we would not expect to see a rise in hospital admissions or deaths... yet. However there is a clear, observable increase in the percentage of positive test results in recent weeks and when you consider the nature of the transmission and associated growth rates, sustained increases in cases will almost certainly lead to more of the vulnerable population being infected.

The USA saw an increase in the number of daily positive cases from the middle of June 2020, partly due to an increase in testing. There was a significant increase in the number of positive cases at the time but initially there was no change in the number of daily deaths. It was only about three weeks later when the number of daily deaths started to increase due to the vulnerable people who had been infected and the typical lag time between infection and death. It is very possible that a large number of vulnerable people living in the UK (likely aged 40 upwards) could end up up as hospital admissions or death statistics this autumn / winter if they do not take COVID-19 seriously and become complacent. The lag time obfuscates the impact of rising case numbers and the changing nature of daily test results may lead to false conclusions when looking at the figures alone.

The Imperial College [antibody study](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/201893/largest-study-home-coronavirus-antibody-testing/) of 100,000 people concluded that just under 6% of the UK public have already had COVID-19 and 0.9% of those infections resulted in deaths. If the 1,500 daily cases reported on 27 August 2020 accounted for all of the new infections (clearly the total number is somewhat higher and the [ONS infection surveys](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/healthandsocialcare/conditionsanddiseases/bulletins/coronaviruscovid19infectionsurveypilot/previousReleases) are a better indicator) that would be 13.5 daily deaths some time down the line. In a nutshell, with a relatively low number of expected deaths from the new daily infections (even accounting for the true number of infections being higher) and a lag of several weeks, we are yet to see a significant impact on the number of daily hospital admissions and deaths. The percentage of future COVID-19 cases leading to death should also be a little lower due to a number of proven therapeutics, leading to improved outcomes for patients.

However, a growing number of cases in the UK is clearly not good because it tells us that the SARS-CoV-2 virus is still present in our society and will continue to spread when given the opportunity. SARS-CoV-2 clearly hasn't gone away (as some claimed it would) and we clearly don't have anything close to "[herd immunity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Herd_immunity)" or the percentage of positive test results would not be increasing with the current social distancing measures in place. The winter of 2020/2021 will be "interesting" to observe when people move back indoors, close their windows, turn on the heating and conditions become more favourable for transmission of the virus.

This is a lot of text for what appears to be a simple question but based on my current understanding of the data, I wouldn't have expected to see a discernible rise in the number of daily deaths in the UK just yet, although I do have my concerns for the coming winter months.



### Did you really have COVID-19?

I regularly see people who believe they had COVID-19 in late 2019, sometimes as early as October. However, if a significant number of people had COVID-19 in October then it is very hard to explain why there is no evidence of associated challenges in hospitals and morgues during late 2019 / early 2020. When SARS-CoV-2 arrived in the UK during [February and March](https://virological.org/t/preliminary-analysis-of-sars-cov-2-importation-establishment-of-uk-transmission-lineages/507) it quickly spread but there is no evidence of the same challenges during late 2019 / early 2020 which would be expected if it were the same virus and disease.

Firstly, ICNARC [reports](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports) for critical care units show that between March and June 2020, COVID-19 admissions equated to over 5 years worth of flu / viral pneumonia patients. It reports over 10,600 COVID-19 patients being admitted to ICU in just a few months, compared to 5,782 patients for flu + viral pneumonia over the last 3 years; 1 January 2017 to 31 December 2019. The most severe COVID-19 patients were initially thought to be suffering from viral pneumonia or acute respiratory distress syndrome ([ARDS](https://www.nhs.uk/conditions/acute-respiratory-distress-syndrome/)) but COVID-19 is now understood to be a much more complicated and serious disease. Around 10% of patients die in ICU after being admitted for the flu / viral pneumonia, compared to the 40-50% of the COVID-19 patients being admitted to ICU between March and June 2020.

Secondly, the latest Public Health England [flu report](https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/annual-flu-reports) shows a perfectly normal flu season for the winter of 2019-2020, essentially over by the end of January 2020. The 69 page report clearly differentiates between flu cases and COVID-19 cases. Through the [USISS](https://digital.nhs.uk/data-and-information/data-collections-and-data-sets/data-collections/icu-hdu-influenza-surveillance) mandatory scheme, a total of 1,802 ICU/HDU admissions of confirmed influenza were reported across the UK from early-October 2019 to late-March 2020, with 103 deaths for England, Scotland and Northern Ireland. The number of COVID-19 admissions to ICU since March 2020 exceeds 10,600 and included over 4,100 deaths as detailed in the latest [COVID-19 report](https://www.icnarc.org/Our-Audit/Audits/Cmp/Reports) published by ICNARC.

Thirdly, ONS [bulletins and datasets](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/latest) for weekly deaths don't show anything out of the ordinary between October and December 2019. This is clear from graphs in my analysis of [excess deaths](https://logiqx.github.io/ons-stats/) over the past 50 years and in the ONS bulletins which report the number of [weekly excess deaths](https://www.ons.gov.uk/peoplepopulationandcommunity/birthsdeathsandmarriages/deaths/bulletins/deathsregisteredweeklyinenglandandwalesprovisional/previousReleases) for 2019/2020.

Fourthly, a study of the SARS-CoV-2 genomes from 20,000 people in the UK with COVID-19 identified the origins as being imported mainly from Italy, Spain and France during [February and March 2020](https://virological.org/t/preliminary-analysis-of-sars-cov-2-importation-establishment-of-uk-transmission-lineages/507) but showed no evidence of common viral ancestors prior to that time. If SARS-CoV-2 was circulating in the UK prior to February and  March 2020, common viral ancestors would have been identified by this study.

Finally, the [earliest confirmed case](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.08.18.20174623v1) of SARS-CoV-2 infection was published by a large teaching hospital in Nottingham, based on a specimen from early-February 2020. The COVID-19 Genomics UK Consortium Study Group used PCR-tested archival specimens collected on admission to the hospital plus available archival specimens submitted for respiratory virus diagnosis, dating back to early January 2020.

Based on the above facts, it seems fair to conclude that whatever was doing the rounds in late 2019 was not SARS-CoV-2 and people were not suffering from COVID-19 at that time. The thousands of people in the UK who had flu-like symptoms in late 2019 but have subsequently suggested it was COVID-19, most likely had the flu which is quite frankly a nasty disease in its own right.



### How many people had COVID-19?

Since COVID-19 was not widespread in the UK until March and April 2020 it is possible to use [serological testing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serology) to establish the likely number of people who have been infected by SARS-CoV-2, even when factoring in the known [sensitivity and specificity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sensitivity_and_specificity) of the tests.

The people who got the most sick from COVID-19 appear to have the most antibodies and the people who had mild symptoms (or were asymptomatic) seem to have fewer antibodies. It is recognised that the number of antibodies being detected after COVID-19 reduces over time (noticeable over a period of months) but they are still detectable long after someone was sick with COVID-19. For example, I have a friend who had COVID-19 relatively mildly in April and tested positive for antibodies in July.

In the UK our antibody testing indicates that around 6% to 7% of the population have had COVID-19 prior to mid-July 2020. A recently published study by [Imperial College](https://www.imperial.ac.uk/news/201893/largest-study-home-coronavirus-antibody-testing/) tested more than 100,000 people and came up with a figure of 6%, whereas a study by the [UK Biobank](https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/2020/07/uk-biobank-covid-19-antibody-study-latest-updates/) tested more than 20,000 people and came up with a figure of 7.1%. Even if we factor in people with possible T-cell immunity it still implies that the vast majority of the UK population are still susceptible to SARS-CoV-2 and COVID-19. There is plenty more "fuel for the fire" and come the winter time when many viruses spread more virulently it is unclear quite what will happen.

Spain was hit badly by COVID-19 in early 2020 and they have done extensive antibody testing to understand how many people may have already had COVID-19. A large antibody [study](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2931483-5/fulltext) has been completed in Spain, testing over 52,000 people and concluded that around 5% of the Spanish population have antibodies and therefore had COVID-19.

A study in Sweden shows that some people without antibodies may show signs of COVID-19 immunity due to T-cell responses. The study shows that the number of people who potentially had COVID-19 either mildly or asymptomatically may be approximately double what the antibody tests indicate but this study is yet to be peer reviewed. These observations relating to T-cell responses may also be related to possible cross-immunity from previous coronavirus infections (not SARS-CoV-2) but this is yet to be fully understood and quantified.
